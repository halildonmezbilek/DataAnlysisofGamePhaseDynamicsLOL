# Data Analysis of Game Phase Dynamics and Their Impact on Match Outcomes in League of Legends

## Introduction
This project explores strategic decision-making in League of Legends (LoL), focusing on how critical events and actions during different game phases impact match outcomes. By analyzing match data from the Turkish servers, this study aims to uncover patterns that contribute to a team's victory, emphasizing the importance of data analytics in understanding competitive MOBA gaming dynamics.

## Literature Review
The study reviews existing research on predicting match outcomes in MOBA games, highlighting the importance of considering various pre-game, in-game, and post-game features to train machine learning models effectively.

## Methodology
The research methodology includes collecting and analyzing data from 14,000 ranked matches across various tiers and ranks, utilizing 3D heatmaps to visualize player movements and strategies, and examining the impact of critical game events on match outcomes.

## Results
Findings reveal patterns in gameplay among winning teams at different skill levels, with a particular focus on the strategic importance of first kills, turret destruction, and game economy management. The analysis suggests that game economy plays a crucial role in determining match outcomes.

## Conclusion
The study concludes that while achieving first kills and destroying turrets are important, managing the game economy is a more decisive factor in winning matches. Further research is recommended to explore the impact of specific in-game items on match outcomes.
